# ðŸ§  Universal Knowledge Graph Builder

A Streamlit application that converts documents into interactive knowledge graphs with natural language Q&A capabilities.

## Features

- **Document Ingestion**: Upload TXT files or fetch content from URLs
- **Entity & Relationship Extraction**: Uses Claude API to intelligently extract entities and their relationships
- **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic, physics-enabled graph visualization with Pyvis
- **Natural Language Q&A**: Ask questions about the knowledge graph and get contextual answers
- **Persistent Storage**: Automatic saving to Neo4j database (if configured)
- **Cross-Document Relationships**: Discovers connections between entities across multiple documents
- **Export Functionality**: Download your knowledge graph as JSON

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Anthropic API key
- Neo4j database (optional, for persistent storage)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd grag
```

2. Install dependencies using uv (recommended):
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e .
```

Or using pip:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your API keys:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your Anthropic API key
   - (Optional) Add Neo4j credentials for persistent storage:
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
   NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io
   NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

### Running the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage

1. **Input Document**:
   - Upload a TXT file (max 100MB)
   - Enter a URL to fetch content
   - Or use the sample document

2. **Build Graph**:
   - Click "Build Knowledge Graph" to process the document
   - Watch as entities and relationships are extracted

3. **Explore**:
   - **Graph Tab**: Interactive visualization with zoom, pan, and physics simulation
   - **Q&A Tab**: Ask natural language questions about the graph
   - **Entities Tab**: View all extracted entities and relationships in tabular format

4. **Export**:
   - Download the complete knowledge graph as JSON

## Technology Stack

- **LLM**: Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku
- **Framework**: LangChain for LLM orchestration
- **UI**: Streamlit
- **Graph Processing**: NetworkX
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j (optional, for persistence)
- **Visualization**: Pyvis
- **Document Processing**: BeautifulSoup4, LangChain text splitters

## Sample Questions

Once you've built a knowledge graph, try asking:
- "Who founded Apple?"
- "What companies are mentioned?"
- "What is the relationship between Steve Jobs and Apple?"
- "How many entities are in the graph?"
- "List all people mentioned"

## Persistent Storage with Neo4j

The app supports Neo4j for persistent graph storage:

- **Automatic Loading**: Graph loads from Neo4j on app startup
- **Auto-Save**: Every processed document is automatically saved to Neo4j
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Your graph persists across browser refreshes and sessions
- **Multi-Document Relationships**: Build connections between entities across multiple documents

### Setting up Neo4j

1. **Neo4j AuraDB (Free Tier)**:
   - Sign up at [neo4j.com/aura](https://neo4j.com/aura)
   - Create a free instance
   - Copy credentials to `.env` file

2. **Local Neo4j**:
   - Download Neo4j Desktop
   - Create local database
   - Use `neo4j://localhost:7687` as URI

### Neo4j Utilities

The project includes utility scripts for managing your Neo4j database:

#### Clear Database
```bash
python clear_neo4j.py
```
Safely clears all data from Neo4j with confirmation prompt.

#### Database Management
```bash
# Show database statistics
python neo4j_utils.py stats

# Search for entities
python neo4j_utils.py search --query "Steve Jobs"

# Get entity details
python neo4j_utils.py details --query "Apple Inc."

# Export graph to JSON
python neo4j_utils.py export --output my_graph.json

# List recent entities
python neo4j_utils.py recent --limit 10

# Clear database (with confirmation)
python neo4j_utils.py clear
```

## Performance Tips

- For large documents, the app automatically chunks text for processing
- Graph visualization is limited to 500 nodes for performance
- Use the physics toggle to improve rendering of large graphs
- Enable caching by not modifying already processed documents
- Neo4j connection provides faster loading for large graphs

## Troubleshooting

**"API key not set" error**:
- Make sure you've added your Anthropic API key to the `.env` file

**Graph not displaying**:
- Try refreshing the view with the refresh button
- Toggle physics on/off
- For very large graphs, the app automatically shows top nodes by connectivity

**Slow processing**:
- Large documents are chunked and processed in batches
- First-time processing is slower; subsequent runs use cached extractions

### Files Required for Deployment

Ensure these files exist in your repository:
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `runtime.txt` - Python version (contains: `python-3.11`)
